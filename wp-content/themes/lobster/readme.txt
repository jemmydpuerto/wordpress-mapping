== About Lobster ==

Launch your new site with Lobster, built with Bootstrap 3.0.2 Lobster is lightweight and fully responsive. You can add your own background, set page layouts and more. Lobster supports eight post formats: Video, Image, Aside, Status, Audio, Quote, Link and Gallery. Recommends using Jetpack and is compatible with bbPress & BuddyPress. Built with Google Fonts, hence 'Lobster', for improved typeface readability and works perfectly across all devices!


== NOTES ==

== HEADER IMAGE ==

To enable the Header Image in the Theme Customizer to go Custom Header and check to the checkbox to enable this feature.


== OVERWRITE THEME-OPTIONS.PHP, CUSTOM-HEADER.PHP AND MEDIA.PHP ==

To overwrite the parents theme's functionality simply copy and paste the parent files into your Child Theme 'inc' folder where you can edit and customize them as you would template files in the root.

For instance in the media.php you can change the Lobster front to any of your chosing, and in the theme-options you can change the star icon or delete it!



== INSTALL CAROUSEL ==
To use the Carousel on the Front Page as displayed in Demo. Download CTP Bootstrap Carousel from: http://wordpress.org/plugins/cpt-bootstrap-carousel/
Open ctp-bootstrap-carousel.php in a text-editor and on line 128 which reads: " 'showcaption' => 'true', " change the showcaption to 'false' like so:

" 'showcaption' => 'false', "

This now hides the caption and the read more link, which do not render well with responsive design.
